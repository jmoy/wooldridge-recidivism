This project contains code and data to reproduce Table 20.1 in Jeffrey
Wooldridge's 'Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data'
using R [http://www.r-project.org ]. Two methods are given, one using
the standard R 'survival' package and the other carrying out the
maximum likelihood computation from scratch and using C code for the
computationally intensive parts.

INSTALLATION 

You need to compile the C code. You can do so by giving
the command R CMD SHLIB recid_c.c

A pre-compiled DLL for Windows is provided for convenience. This was
compiled using GCC v. 4.5.2 on MinGW on 32-bit Windows with R version
2.11.1

USAGE 

The function read.recid() reads in the data a returns it as a
data frame.

The function recid.mle() performs maximum likelihood estimation from
scratch to reproduce the table. It returns an object of class
mle-class. Use the summary method on this object to see the standard
errors.

The function recid.survreg() uses the survreg function from the
'survival' library to reproduce the table.
